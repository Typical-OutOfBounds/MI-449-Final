            I spent this year very differently than the last. School and learning has always been something that is very important to me, but last year, having a more “normal” year after COVID, I spent less time on my classes and a lot more time going out. My late nights and weekday drinking had taken a toll on my classes, and at the end of the year, I was stressed out and not happy with my grades.

Determined to get back on the right path, I dedicated this year towards learning and doing well in my classes. I was ready finish my undergraduate career strong and start my job, but then an unexpected layoff hit, and now the workplace I had been interning at for two summers could not keep me and many others. I had to get back into job search mode quick. Thankfully with a subpar resume and just a little bit of practicing my algorithm skills, I was able to get an offer for a great job in Chicago. 
The experience was scary and definitely a reality check, but when I look at the situation optimistically, I would have been complacent staying at my previous job, and the unfortunate situation pushed me to grow and advance my career.
